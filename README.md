# GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework
In February 2017, the IAB Europe assembled parties representing various participants in the online advertising ecosystem, in particular parties from both the supply and demand side of the ecosystem, to work collectively on guidance and solutions to the requirements of the General DataProtectionRegulation(the“GDPR”). That working group is currently known as the GDPR Implementation Working Group (or the “GIG”)). One of the working groups within the GIG was tasked with developing guidance on consent as a legal basis of processing. An additional working group developed out of that working group to develop a standard solution for companies to use, where and if necessary, to request, obtain and disseminate consent to various parties in the online advertising ecosystem that may be relying on consent as a legal basis of processing and/or may have parties integrated with them that rely on consent. IAB Tech Lab is charged with the technical governance of these specs. These documents are drafts for public comment. 
Please submit your general feedback to feedback@advertisingconsent.eu and any technical feedback to transparencyframework@iabtechlab.com  by April 8, 2018.
